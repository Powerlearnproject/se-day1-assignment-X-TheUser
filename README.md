Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the procedure of planning, creating, assessing and servicing software applications. Software engineering plays an important role within the technology industry by empowering the production of software applications and software systems that drive several strands of modern life such as transportation and business growth.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

In the 1960s software engineering was found as a speciality. In the 1960s whilst starting with the instructions and map-reading structures for the Apollo mission, Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist and systems engineer conceived the name software engineering. She believed that software developers gained the right to be named engineers (Wiliams, 2024). 

In the 1970s there was the emergence organised programming. This time in software engineering initiated a new method of composing software. Organised programming brings attention to rational structures and processes, ensuring that it is simpler to have knowledge of and correct software. At this time, numerous influential programming languages were created such as Fortran by Nicklaus Wirth and C by MacAlistair Richie. The programming languages ensured that it was viable to create compound software, thus pushing the rise of software engineering (Institute of Data, 2024).

In the 2000s there was the emergence of nimble procedures. This time witnessed the establishment of agile methodologies, which focused on fluidity and consumer participation across fixed procedures and recording. Agile methods, such as Extreme Programming (widely known as XP), have developed into being guideline within software development. The methods have assisted in raising the pace and coherence of software development, ensuring that it is viable to bring exceptional software within concise time limits (Institute of Data, 2024).

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - Interpreting the extent of the design, the targets, the schedule and the means issued.
2. Requirements - Assembling and recording user requirements and system needs.
3. Design - Developing the system structure, user link, and comprehensive scheme records.
4. Implementation - Composing the code and constructing the software based on the scheme's requirements.
5. Testing - Running tests to make sure the software encounters quality standards and practical needs.
6. Deployment - Delivering the software to its targeted users.
7. Maintenance - Providing help to users, updates and improvements to the software after it has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
